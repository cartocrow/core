/// Representation of a necklace map for a set of regions and a set of
/// necklaces.
///
/// A *necklace map* is a type of proportional symbol map in which the symbols
/// displaying the data values for each region (here called *beads*) are moved
/// away from the regions themselves and instead placed on one or more curves
/// surrounding the map called *necklaces*:
///
/// \image html necklace-map-example.png
///
/// The intent of this drawing style is to reduce the clutter caused by symbols
/// covering up their regions. Necklace maps were introduced by Speckmann and
/// Verbeek \cite necklace_maps_tvcg. This class implements the algorithm for
/// the construction of necklace maps described in the companion paper
/// \cite necklace_maps_ijcga.
///
/// ## Algorithm description
///
/// A necklace map consists of one or more regions and one or more necklaces,
/// where each region is mapped to a necklace. Necklaces can be circles (\ref
/// CircleNecklace) or BÃ©zier splines (\ref BezierNecklace). To compute the
/// map, each region is assigned a _feasible region_ on its necklace (see \ref
/// IntervalType). The beads are then placed inside their feasible regions using
/// an attraction/repulsion force model. All beads can be uniformly scaled; the
/// algorithm returns the optimal scale factor for the beads (\ref
/// scaleFactor()), such that they can all be placed on their necklace without
/// any overlap.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// The intended way to compute a necklace map is like this:
/// ```
/// necklace_map::NecklaceMap map(regions);
///
/// // add necklaces
/// auto n1 = map.addNecklace(
/// 	std::make_unique<CircleNecklace>(Circle<Inexact>(Point<Inexact>(0, 0), 100)));
/// auto n2 = map.addNecklace(
/// 	std::make_unique<CircleNecklace>(Circle<Inexact>(Point<Inexact>(200, 0), 150)));
///
/// // add beads
/// map.addBead("NL", 17'000'000, n1);
/// map.addBead("BE", 12'000'000, n1);
/// // ...
/// map.addBead("DE", 83'000'000, n1);
/// // ...
///
/// // set parameters (optional)
/// map.parameters().buffer_rad = 0.1;
/// map.parameters().interval_type = necklace_map::IntervalType::kCentroid;
///
/// // run computation
/// map.compute();
/// ```
///
/// The necklace map can be viewed or exported by creating a \ref
/// necklace_map::Painting "Painting" and passing it to the desired \ref
/// renderer::GeometryRenderer "GeometryRenderer":
/// ```
/// necklace_map::Painting painting(map);
///
/// cartocrow::renderer::GeometryWidget widget(painting);
/// widget.show();
/// // or
/// renderer::IpeRenderer renderer(painting);
/// renderer.save("some_filename.ipe");
/// ```
